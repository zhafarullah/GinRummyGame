# Gin Rummy card game with image processing and CNN for card recognition
## Description 
This game is a customized Gin Rummy card game. This game utilizes CNN and Image Processing to recognize cards. The game is played by a player and a bot, at the beginning of the game, the player is asked to scan the player and bot cards with a camera.

The purpose of this program is for my image and video processing assignments for my lectures, emphasizing the image processing aspect. So if there is anything wrong I apologize.

I only use the train folder for this project.

If you are looking only recognition and classification of the cards without the game, you can see it here:
